- Groups segment shows critical 61% cancellation rate, indicating significant revenue risk
- Direct bookings demonstrate strongest commitment with only 15.3% cancellation rate
- Medium-stay guests (3-5 nights) drive 47% of total revenue ($20.2M) despite representing only 44% of bookings
- Travel Agent/Tour Operator channel accounts for 82% of all bookings (97,870) but suffers 41% cancellation rate
**Recommendations:**
- Implement differential cancellation policies for Groups segment with non-refundable deposits to reduce revenue volatility
- Develop direct booking incentive program to shift channel mix away from high-commission OTAs while reducing cancellations
- Deploy dynamic pricing algorithms for Resort Hotels to optimize revenue per available room given lower booking density
- Create targeted packages encouraging 3-5 night stays to maximize revenue per booking efficiency
